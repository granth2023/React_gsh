# Project File Management System

A robust platform for securely managing and serving project files, leveraging MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js (MERN stack). This system allows for the creation and storage of projects, each containing multiple files, with password-protected access to sensitive content.

## Features

- **Secure File Access**: Password protection for accessing sensitive files within a project.
- **Dynamic Content Management**: Easily manage projects and their files through a MongoDB database.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Navigate and interact with projects using a React-based frontend.
- **Efficient Data Retrieval**: Serve project data and files efficiently with Express and Mongoose.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure your MongoDB URI in `.env`
4. Start the server: `npm start`
5. Navigate to `localhost:3001` to view the project interface

## Usage

- To add a new project, POST to `/api/projects` with project details.
- Access project details by navigating to `/project/:projectId`.
- Secure files can be accessed after providing the correct access password.
